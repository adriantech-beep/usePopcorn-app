# React + Vite

This app was built along with my course on Udemy.
Through this app i learned a lot on how  to use a useEffect and how the dependency array works and how it is important.
I also learned how to make a reusable component through this project.
We built the app originally on Create-React-App but i managed to transfer it on Vite.

A big credits to Sir @jonasschmedtmann instructor from Udemy for this kind of project.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
